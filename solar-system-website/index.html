  <h2>What is Solar System?</h2>  
  <p>The Solar System consists of the Sun and the bodies that orbit it (most prominently Earth), being a system of masses bound together by gravity. The name comes from Sōl, the Latin name for the Sun.</p>  
  <p>It formed about <b>4.6 billion years ago </b>when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, creating the Sun and a protoplanetary disc from which the orbiting bodies assembled.</p>

  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRh6WRgmzhI8VJuIkAnNIHWyFnrmJZUYbSH0Q&usqp=CAU" width="200">  
  <p><b>Mercury </b> is the <b>smallest planet </b> in our solar system and the closest to the Sun,with a heavily cratered, rocky surface similar to Earth's Moon. </p>  
  <p>It is known for its <b>extreme temperature </b>fluctuations, the fastest orbit (88 Earth days), and a very slow rotation, which makes one solar day last longer than its year.</p>    <h3>♀️ Venus</h3>  
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTd0F3qOJBJ6TNkEw18Lb-vKuEHZ3z8L9p5JA&usqp=CAU" width="200">  
  <p><b>Venus </b> is the second planet from the Sun and Earth's closest neighbor,known for its extreme heat caused by a thick, toxic atmosphere.</p>  
  <p>It is similar in size to Earth, earning it the nickname <b> sister planet</b> ,but a runaway greenhouse effect makes its surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.</p>    <h3>🌍 Earth</h3>  
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTMo_d27e8PYdsTUrKEGVukTQsFNo7xT5zN4g&usqp=CAU" width="200">  
  <p><b>Earth </b> is the third planet from the Sun,and the only known<b> planet to host life.</b> It is composed of four layers—inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust—and its surface is about 71% water, giving it the nickname the "blue planet".</p>  
  <p>Earth's atmosphere, rotation, and distance from the sun create conditions that support a wide variety of life, including its single natural satellite, the <b>Moon.</b></p>    <h3>♂️ Mars</h3>  
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRSA5VYcgFaaPwNhpfQhunsjKrKSnc8kCz20g&usqp=CAU" width="200">  
  <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun,known as the <b>Red Planet</b> ,due to iron oxide in its soil.It has a thin atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide, a day that is about 24.6 hours long, and a year that is almost twice as long as an Earth year, at 687 Earth days.</p>  
  <p>Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, and has two small moons named Phobos and Deimos.</p>    <h3>🪐 Jupiter</h3>  
  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTv1BrAkNj6ddnRtJruKaQ5KCSAkkzGuPavxQ&usqp=CAU" width="200">  
  <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system,a "gas giant" located fifth from the Sun. It is a world of extreme storms, including the Great Red Spot,</p>  
  <p>and is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium with a "stripy" appearance from swirling cloud bands. Jupiter also has a complex system of many moons and a powerful magnetic field.</p>    <h3>🪐 Saturn</h3>  
  <img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*2u5Hf8A9MxDHXU40eYlmbw.png" width="200">  
  <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun,and the second-largest in our solar system. It is a gas giant known for its prominent rings, which are made of ice and rock particles. The planet is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium,</p>  
  <p>making it the least dense planet in the solar system, so much so that it would float in water if a large enough body of it existed. It has a fast rotation, with a day lasting just over 10 hours, and takes about 29.5 Earth years to orbit the Sun.</p>    <h3>🌀 Uranus</h3>  
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Uranus_Voyager2_color_calibrated.png" width="200">  
  <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun,known as an ice giant due to its composition of water, methane, and ammonia ices above a small, rocky core.</p>  
  <p>It is the third-largest planet in the solar system and is famous for its extreme axial tilt, causing it to rotate on its side. This tilt results in unique seasonal extremes, and the planet's blue-green color comes from the methane in its atmosphere absorbing red light.</p>    <h3>🌊 Neptune</h3>  
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Neptune_Full.jpg/250px-Neptune_Full.jpg" width="200">  
  <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet,an ice giant known for its deep blue color, strong winds, and large storms.</p>  
  <p>It is similar to Uranus in composition, made of a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and methane, with a dense fluid of water, ammonia, and methane ice surrounding a rocky core. Neptune has 14 moons and faint rings and takes about 165 Earth years to orbit the Sun. </p>

  <h2>🚀 Space Missions</h2>    <h3>🇮🇳 Chandrayaan-3 (India)</h3>  
  <img src="https://currentaffairs.khanglobalstudies.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chandrayaan-3.webp" width="200">  
  <p>Chandrayaan-3 was India's third lunar mission, designed to demonstrate soft-landing and roving capabilities on the Moon's surface. It achieved a historic soft landing near the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023,</p>  
  <p>making India the first nation to do so and the fourth overall to achieve a Moon landing. The mission's components included the Vikram lander and the Pragyan rover, which collected data on seismicity, thermophysical properties, and the plasma environment. </p>    <h3>🇺🇸 Apollo 11 (USA)</h3>  
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Apollo_11_Launch_-_GPN-2000-000630.jpg/250px-Apollo_11_Launch_-_GPN-2000-000630.jpg" width="200">  
  <p>Apollo 11 was the NASA spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon, launching on July 16, 1969, and returning on July 24, 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins were on the mission.</p>  
  <p>Armstrong and Aldrin became the first people to walk on the lunar surface, while Collins orbited above in the command module. The mission fulfilled a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth before the end of the decade.</p>    <h3>🇮🇳 Mangalyaan (India)</h3>  
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6b/Mars_Orbiter_Mission_Over_Mars_%2815237158879%29.jpg" width="200">  
  <p>Mangalyaan was India's first interplanetary mission, launched by ISRO in 2013 to orbit Mars and study its surface and atmosphere. </p>  
  <p>It was a historic success, making India the first Asian nation to reach Mars' orbit and the first to do so on its maiden attempt. The mission was cost-effective and carried five scientific instruments to collect data on Mars' mineralogy, dust storms, and methane levels, among other things.</p>
